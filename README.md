Lots and lots of flags

You can get the flag for any country just by its two-letter code. Just access http://flags.ox3.in/svg/xx.svg, where "xx" is the [ISO 3166 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements) country code (in lowercase).

This repository also has flags for many subdivisions of countries (including U.S. states, Canadian provinces, etc). Just access http://flags.ox3.in/svg/xx/yyy.svg, where "xx" is the first part of the [ISO 3166-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2#Current_codes) code and "yyy" is the second part after the dash (again, both parts in lowercase).

If SVGs don't suit your purpose, you can also access very low resolution PNGs via http://flags.ox3.in/mini/xx.png and http://flags.ox3.in/mini/xx/yyy.png; however, this might not be maintained in the future.
